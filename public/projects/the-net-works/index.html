        The cyber environment of the messenger Telegram is where heinous digital
        sex crimes known as the "Nth Room" case took place between 2018 and
        2020. The scandal's victims are at least 1,154 women with 60.7% of them
        as teenagers and at least 26 of them as minors.

        by December 30, 2020. All perpetrators of the crimes are about 60,000
        users, who used over 260,000 login IDs.

      <h3>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1-1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nth Room
      </h3>
      <p>
        The original "Nth room" chats appeared on Telegram in 2018, when the
        former users of "Soranet," a notorious illegal web platform for sharing
        sexually exploitative videos in South Korea, finally shut down. The
        former "Soranet" users chose none other than Telegram as their next
        platform to continue their sexual exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user nicknamed "god-god" found his victims on Twitter, where he
        approached accounts with self-made, pornographic contents whose users
        are women in their 10s and 20s. He impersonated a police officer simply
        with a message stating he's from the cyber investigative team who received reports 
        about the receiver's account for pornography, and therefore
        requesting a statement on the matter from the account's owner. He sent
        the message along with a hacking link to extract personal information
        from those who fell for the trick and filled it out. Using the extracted
        personal information, user "god-god" threatened and forced victims to
        produce degrading or pornographic videos. He then shared the extorted
        videos in 8 secret chats that he operated on Telegram, namely room 1 to
        room 8, thus "nth" rooms, where he regularly shared the extorted,
        exploitative videos. The structure of exploitation in these initial
        chatrooms influenced all copycats later on.
      </p>
      <h3>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1-2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doctor's Room
      </h3>
      <p>
        A user nickednamed "doctor" emerged in July 2019, and approached his
        victims on social media platforms like Instagram or Twitter, offered
        them underwear modeling gigs or light sex work gigs, extracted personal
        information and nudes of those who accepted the offers, and used the
        extorted information and photographs to force the victims to produce
        dehumanizing and sexually exploitative videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the operator of the "Nth room," user "doctor" sought financial
        profit from his exploitation, and sold his videos in cryptocurrency in
        his chatrooms. "Doctor's room" was deliberately structured,
        payment-based, exclusive chatroom model. "Doctor's room" consisted of 4
        chatrooms, including charge-free trial room, level 1 room, level 2 room,
        and level 3 room. Entrance fee for entering level 1 room ranged between
        200,000 and 250,000 Korean Won ($170-215 USD), entering level 2 room
        cost 700,000 Korean Won ($620 USD), and level 3 room was as expensive as
        1,500,000 Korean Won ($1,300 USD). All transactions were made in
        cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. During transactions, a copy of the
        paying users' ID cards were demanded, so that user "doctor" could hold
        onto payers' personal informaiton.

        2. Cyber Sexual Abuse
      </h3>
      <p>
        The cases involved the following digital sex crimes: blackmailing,
        sexual extortion, cybersex trafficking, sexual assault, and image-based
        sexual abuse (IBSA), which altogether occurred in a sort of cyclically
        repetitive series. These sexual crimes took advantage of the varied
        technological features of Telegram app in order to continue the long
        term, large scale, and multilayered abuses.
      </p>
      <h3>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2-1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cyber-Enabled-Crime
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cybercrimes has two primary categories: advanced cybercrime and
        cyber-enabled-crime. The latter, cyber-enabled-crime, includes sexual
        extortion and sexual exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Nth Room" traffickers made their first online contacts with the
        victims on social media services such as Twitter or Instagram, extracted
        their basic information through impersonation or manipulation, illegally
        hacked government offices for further acquisition of personal
        information, and then commanded the victims to move to Telegram for
        future interactions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2-2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sexual Abuse
      </h3>
      <p>
        Among the methods of sexual abuse are human sex trafficking, an example
        of sexual exploitation, and sexual extortion or sextortion, which is a
        type of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA).

      </h3>
      <p>
        Telegram is private and secure. The messages on Telegram can
        self-destruct, and it can be planned to occur at a certain time. The
        high-tech encryption allowed for great anonymity, which made untraceable
        abuses possible. As we see with unaccounted trafficking, countless
        unaccounted viewings of assaults were also due to the features of
        privacy and security. The users could use aliases and stay
        underdetected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Telegram uses Client-to-Client or End-to-End User encryption technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MTProto encryption scheme, which is a symmetric encryption, is the
        core system of Telegram's encryptive technology. The following image is
        a simplified illustration of the MTProto encryption scheme.

      <p>
        Telegram is also social and expressive. Telegram groups can hold up to
        200,000 members, and users can fully customize their own messaging
        environment. The app provided a new way to communicate, and it is
        unclear how many men paid for this footage, how many messaging apps are
        involved or how many copycat chat rooms have been made.

      <div class="question">
        IS AMORALITY RESPONSIBLE?
      </div>
      <p>
        The_Net_Works wants to ask the undermentioned questions about the hidden
        dangers of our seemingly democratic, liberatory communication tools. It
        dissects how encryption and interaction technologies, when deployed
        within a violently abusive culture, can cause unprecedented damage on
        personal and societal levels. It is extremely critical for advanced
        technological tools to cooperate in achieving justice in the face of
        exploited humanity, as well as to take responsibility in creating not
        passively neutral but actively equitable cyberspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of binary discourses on digital democracy and
        technoliberalism, the philosophies of privacy, anonymity, and freedom in
        relation to the technologies of encryption and sociability are all in a
        blur.
