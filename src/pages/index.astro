            Hanul grew up in South Korea, near the ocean and mountains. "Hanul"
            means "sky" in Korean and is a pure
            <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hangul</a></u>
            word. Hanul spent most of their adult life in New York City, where they
            earned a
            <u><a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/bfa-design-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFA in Design and Technology</a></u>

            a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.

          Hanul's body of work encompasses a diverse array of projects such as
          algorithmically generated visuals, data-driven infographics, and
          immersive XR narratives, highlighting their proficiency across
          multiple disciplines. They utilize a variety of software tools to
          bring their ideas to life, and are always learning something new.
          "Remember to imagine and craft the world you cannot live without, just as you dismantle the ones you cannot live within," said <u><a href="https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruha Benjamin</a></u>. In their creative practice, Hanul critically re-examines the
          current state of things, re-imagines their content and structure, and
          re-builds them in digital environments. Hanul believes that
          envisioning alternative versions of the world can help us work towards
          a better reality.

        <p class="disclosure-content">
          Born in the mid 90s and raised in South Korea, Hanul witnessed the
          emergence of internet culture and its impact on many aspects of
          everyday life. Hanul grew up on SayClub and <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyworld</a></u>, Korea's earliest social networking platforms, and read <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webtoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webtoons</a></u>, which are digital comics created, shared, and enjoyed fully online.
          This formative engagement with internet culture has furnished Hanul
          with a multi-faceted comprehension of digital technology's pervasive
          influence on communication and entertainment. This sustained engagement 
          with networked culture gave Hanul a nuanced understanding of technology’s 
          social and cultural roles. Their work continues to explore the relationship 
          among art, media, and technology in ways that support <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user-centered design</a></u> and <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human-centered computing</a></u>.
