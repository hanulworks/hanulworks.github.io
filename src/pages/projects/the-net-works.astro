    <p class="subject">WHAT</p>
    <p class="text">
      This research project delves into the cyber environment of the messaging
      platform Telegram, specifically analyzing its role in the infamous "Nth
      Room" case, a harrowing example of sextortion and human trafficking. The
      project sheds light on the often-overlooked aspects of Telegram's
      technical features that may have facilitated these crimes. Employing an
      ethnographic approach, the research is visualized as an interactive web
      map resource. This contribution aims to serve as a valuable tool for
      online communities and collectives working towards global justice in the
      fight against digital sex crimes.
    </p>

    <p class="subject">WHY</p>
    <p class="text">
      This project investigates the role of Telegram, a secure and widely used
      messaging platform, in facilitating the horrific "Nth Room" case. This
      case involved a series of interconnected digital sex crimes, including
      blackmail, sextortion, and the distribution of exploitative content. While
      the crimes have received significant attention, the technical aspects of
      Telegram that may have enabled them remain largely unexamined.
      <br /><br />
      This research addresses this gap by employing an ethnographic approach to analyze
      Telegram's cyber environment. By examining the "Nth Room" case through this
      lens, the project aims to illuminate how specific features of the platform
      may have contributed to the crimes' scope, duration, and complexity. The resulting
      web map resource, "The Net Works," serves as a critical exploration of this
      connection, offering valuable insights for online safety advocates and policymakers
      working to combat digital sex crimes.
    </p>

    <p class="subject">HOW</p>
    <p class="text">
      This project employs an ethnographic approach to investigate the Telegram
      environment in the context of the "Nth Room" case. Ethnography involves
      immersing oneself in a particular social setting to understand its culture
      and practices. In this case, the research analyzes user behavior, platform
      functionalities, and the broader online discourse surrounding the case.
      <br /><br />
      By examining how Telegram's features (e.g., encryption, anonymity) potentially
      interacted with the abusive culture within the platform, the project illuminates
      the factors that may have contributed to the crimes' severity and scale. This
      analysis is visualized through an interactive web-based map, "The Net Works,"
      which illustrates these interconnections and serves as a tool for online safety
      advocates and policymakers.
      <br /><br />
      The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship
      between technology and social harm. It challenges simplistic narratives of
      "democratic technology" by exposing how seemingly neutral tools can be repurposed
      for harm. Ultimately, this research sparks critical conversations about privacy,
      anonymity, and the ethical responsibilities of technology companies in creating
      safer online spaces.

      and Comparative Analysis of Overseas Crime Prediction System Using
      Artificial Intelligence.” Journal of Digital Convergence 18.7 (2020):

    <p class="text">
      This article, authored by the CEO of the Global Digital Sexual Crime
      Policy Research Institute, offers a critical analysis of the "Nth Room"
      case. The author delves into the criminal methods employed, highlighting
      how the perpetrators exploited Telegram's secure communication features
      and darkcoin exchange systems. The article emphasizes the devastating
      mental and psychological impact on the victims, prompting a necessary
      discussion about the role of technology in facilitating new forms of
      sexual exploitation.
      <br /><br />
      Several key findings resonate with this project. First, the article underscores
      cyber sextortion as the initial step in a multi-layered exploitation process.
      Second, it raises the important issue of "possession" in the context of image-based
      sexual abuse, where streaming distribution is becoming more prevalent. Third,
      the article highlights the responsibility of digital platforms to prevent the
      spread of exploitative content. In the "Nth Room" case, Telegram's refusal
      to cooperate with the investigation due to privacy concerns is a critical point.
      <br /><br />
      The research also identifies challenges in combating these crimes, such as
      the limitations of tracing cryptocurrency transactions across foreign exchanges
      and the ease with which evidence can be deleted on platforms like Telegram.
      These insights are valuable as this project explores the connections between
      criminal methodologies and the technological features that enable them.

    <p class="text">
      This article provides a valuable framework for analyzing cyber sexual
      abuse, particularly relevant to the "Nth Room" case. The author
      effectively introduces key concepts and terminology related to cybercrime,
      including the distinction between "advanced cybercrime" and "cyber-enabled
      crime." Critically, the article focuses on cyber-enabled crimes, which
      encompass sexual extortion and exploitation – the core methods of abuse in
      the "Nth Room" case. This contextualization helps position the research
      within the broader landscape of cyber sexual abuse.
      <br /><br />
      Beyond definitions, the article explores the ways in which the internet and
      social media facilitate these crimes. It delves into various types of online
      sexual predators and their methods. The chapter "The Different Acts of Abuse
      that are Committed Using the Internet" is particularly insightful, providing
      detailed explanations of relevant methods like human sex trafficking (sexual
      exploitation) and sextortion, both crucial aspects of the "Nth Room" case.

    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Focused on cyber sextortion as a form of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA),
      this article provides valuable insights for analyzing this project's
      subject. The authors conducted a qualitative content analysis of media
      articles and court documents related to 152 cyber sextortion offenders.
      Their analysis identified four key themes, including two particularly
      relevant to the "Nth Room" case: minor-focused offenders and
      cybercrime-oriented offenders.
      <br /><br />
      The article highlights three key characteristics that differentiate cyber sextortion
      from other interpersonal crimes: the cyberspace element, the possession of
      compromising material, and the extortion component. Despite diverse motivations
      (sex, power, dominance, coercion, or money), cyber sextortion offenders often
      employ similar methods. The article's data-driven approach offers helpful examples
      for structuring analytical frameworks.
