    <h6 class="section">I. PROPOSAL</h6>
    <p class="subject">BACKGROUND</p>
    <p class="text">
      Many U.S. universities reduced or centralized on‑campus counseling services during the pandemic. At Parsons and The New School, students expressed an ongoing need for safe, repeatable spaces to process stress, build peer support, and access professional guidance. The proposal explores how extended‑reality tools can widen access and create privacy by design.
    </p>

    <p class="subject">OPPORTUNITY</p>
    <p class="text">
      The New School’s XReality Center maintains head‑mounted displays and VR‑ready workstations. Leveraging this infrastructure, the university can pilot a small, credit‑bearing course that combines group therapy methods with avatar‑based presence. The format emphasizes accessibility, consent, and data minimization from the outset.
    </p>

    <p class="subject">INITIATIVE</p>
    <p class="text">
      <strong>VR Therapy 101</strong> is a two‑credit elective designed around moderated group sessions. Students participate as avatars in an intentionally calm virtual setting. Licensed facilitators guide weekly meetings that focus on mutual support, reflective prompts, and healthy digital habits. The course positions mental health as a core part of design education.

    </figure>

    <p class="subject">USER EXPERIENCE</p>
    <p class="text">
      Students book headsets through the equipment center or join from VR‑capable labs on campus. After a short onboarding, they enter a private virtual room where session norms are reviewed. The interaction model is intentionally simple—spatial audio, seated interaction, and a limited set of gestures—to reduce cognitive load and prioritize conversation.
    </p>

    <p class="subject">VR PROTOTYPE</p>
    <figure class="detailImage">
      <img src="/projects/vr-therapy-101/vr-prototype.png" alt="Prototype screenshots of the VR group room" loading="lazy" />
    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      The prototype features adjustable lighting, soft environmental sound, and a central circle layout. Safety is handled through quick mute, instant facilitator ping, and one‑tap exit to a private lobby. No conversations are recorded. Attendance is stored only as course participation data in accordance with university policy.

    <h6 class="section">III. COURSE FORMAT</h6>
    <p class="subject">PROGRAM STRUCTURE</p>
    <p class="text">
      • Two academic credits<br />
      • Weekly 75‑minute sessions over eight weeks<br />
      • Enrollment and withdrawal follow university policy<br />
      • Participation‑based evaluation with brief reflections
    </p>

    <p class="subject">EDUCATIONAL VALUE</p>
    <p class="text">
      The course helps students build collaborative care practices, experience ethical XR design first‑hand, and evaluate how presence technologies shape communication. The pilot also generates guidelines for disability access, privacy, and facilitation that can inform future XR initiatives at the university.
